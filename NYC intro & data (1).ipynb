Among big cities in States, especially New York City can be nicely expressed with the nick name above (\"melting pot\").

    "\n",
    "In this chapter, I am going to expalain how I've approach to the target business (restaurant business) and supporting sentences for my choice. As you know, there are the neccessities of life. They are food, clothing, and shelters. First of all, I made a focus on those essential things for human life. Next, I thought about the way to extremely take benefits of the environmental characterstics of New York City. The main key of my decesion is \"floating population\" of New York City. As I made a comment above, population of New York City is more than 23 million. Then, let us think about floating population. New York shares its borders with five states: Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Vermont, Connecticut, and Massachusetts [6]. Numerous people are commuting to or through New York City from surrounding States/Cities. Moreover, we should remember that various people from other countries visit New York City through airway for traveling or business trip. Finally, I sorted the best item among human necessities to make fit for this floating population. Fianlly, I choose the food among human essentials and easly approach to business item as a restaurant one.    "
